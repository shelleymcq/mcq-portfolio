I wrote scripts to automate tasks and save developersâ€™ time, and have written code to customize list virtualization when no existing JavaScript library would work out-of-the-box. And I just became BigCommerce certified.</p>

          <p className="px-6 py-2 text-slate-300 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">Throughout my teaching career, I have honed my communication and problem-solving skills, as well as my ability to work in a team. These skills translate extremely well to software development teams, where collaboration and effective communication are essential. I have experience collaborating with remote teams around the world and am comfortable with tools such as JIRA. Additionally, I have experience with Agile methodologies, pair programming, reviewing pull requests, and providing constructive feedback to team members. Then there's tackling bug tickets. I love getting my Nancy Drew on to hunt down a glitch.</p>
